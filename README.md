 ##  Hospital Management System SQL Project  ##
Overview:
Hospitals are vital institutions striving to provide the best medical care to people suffering from various illnesses, which may arise due to climate changes, increased workload, emotional trauma, stress, and other factors. Managing daily hospital activities and records manually is highly challenging and inefficient. Therefore, a robust database system is essential to accurately maintain all hospital operations and records.

Project Aim:
Hospitals interact with numerous patients and staff daily, involving various complex tasks such as managing doctor schedules, patient diagnoses, and medical histories. This project demonstrates how these tasks can be efficiently managed using a relational database system.

By storing information within a relational database, daily hospital functions can be automated and streamlined, improving accuracy and operational efficiency. This Hospital Database Management System (DBMS) project is designed to provide an effective, user-friendly solution for storing, retrieving, and managing healthcare-related data.

Database Components
The database comprises the following seven core tables:
1.Physician
2.Affiliated With
3.Department
4.Nurse
5.Patient
6.Patient Diagnosis
7.Procedures

Technology Stack
